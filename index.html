						<h3>Making exercise a habit is <span class="make-yellow">particularly problematic</span>.</h3>
						<p>When people set out to make exercise a habit, they usually start exercising 3 or more days on week #1, then again on week #2; but before long, they start exercising less frequently each week, until completely falling off the wagon. <b>Studies show 50% of people give up in 6 weeks or less.</b></p>
						<p>Getting motivated to exercise is tricky because the short term reward is too small compared to the effort required; therefore, if people rely on willpower alone, which is an inconsistent source of motivation, they will likely choose to not exercise today. </p>
